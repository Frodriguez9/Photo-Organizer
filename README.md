# photo-organizer

A desktop program that organizes photos by their location title using regular expresions

## The purpose of the program is to:
	•	Show my ability to use the os and sys modules in Python
	•	Make a cool, functional program ! XD 

## Disclosure:
This was a guided exercise from the book 'Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.' As I usually do when I am learning, I don't look at any code unless I am terribly stuck. As a result, my solution is slightly different than the one proposed by its author, Al Sweigart.
